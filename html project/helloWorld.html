			After graduating from high school I had no idea what I wanted to do. I knew I
			<br>
			wanted to do something meaningful with my life but I didn't know where to start.
			<br>
			Luckily for me, a friend of mine told me that while I try to figure out what I
			<br>
			wanted to do, I should take some courses at El Camino College. And during my
			<br>
			first year I did just that. I took a few classes, enrolled in programs and joined a
			<br>
			club. However, during my second year I met with my counselor and told them 
			<br>
			my dilemma. I explained how I wanted to do something that I loved but I didn't
			<br>
			know where to start. They asked me what I was passionate about and after telling
			<br>
			them I loved video games they recommended that I try computer science (aka 
			<br>
			coding). Now I admit, when I would hear about coding I would think of movies
			<br>
			like the matrix. An endless amount of lines of text filling the entire screen of a
			<br>
			computer. However, not knowing where to start, I took a chance and I enrolled in the
			<br>
			intro course for computer science. And this is where my passion for computer science
			<br> 
			rooted. I was told to make a very simple program that just printed out "Hello, world!"
			<br>
			I wrote the simple sentence, I added the necessary syntax and I compiled my program.
			<br>
			After seeing my code execute in the command line, I felt something. I felt a sense of
			<br>
			pride, and I felt really really cool. Ever since that moment I continued to take 
			<br>
			classes for computer science. And with each class that I took my interest for computer
			<br>
			science grew. Fast forward a few semesters and I am now enrolled in Advanced C++,
			<br>
			still loving computer science.
